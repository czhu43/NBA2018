#for my own effieciency index:
#efficiency_new = 1.5*points + steals + rebounds  - turnovers - 2*fouls 
#rationale: I think for an nba player, points are the most crucial thing, so I increased the weight on points by a factor of 1.5; additionally, fouls detract from the total efficiency of the team, so I also subtracted by a factor of 2* fouls (they detract from the efficiency, but the number of fouls doesn't ictate a team's ability: more aggressive teams may make more fouls but might also play better because of their aggressive nature, so boosting points (+ still including steals etc) accounts for that; I took away the missed free throws etc. because I think that in terms of basketball, people are most interested in who can bring the most points to the table)

**Comments and reflections**
I think in general, learning new things about visualization (e.g. adding lines/ random little things) took time to search up: due to my lack of practice, I also had some difficulty getting dplyr things right. For example, even though I've used mutate a lot it took me a while to realize that doing teams<-mutate(dat2,....) was messing up the rest of my data, because it undid my previous changes/ groupings etc. It took me probably 3.5 hours to finish this even though everything was fairly basicâ€”I think I need to become more familiar with a lot of the packages/ implications of dataframes in addition to things like round() which I had to search up. I also think it took some time to process what the assignment was really asking for, and of course, trying to build the data dictionary took me a long time just from tedious copy pasting the syntax for a table. This wasn't my first time using an R Script, but I still definitely prefer markdown. I think learning about all the new visualization stuff though was a lot of fun + things like write functions and sink functions
