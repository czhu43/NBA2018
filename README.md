This involves manipulating data from NBA players in the 2018 season. Here we've produced cleaned and reorganized dataset nba2018-teams.csv which makes it easier to analyze the data based on team performance rather than individual players. Additionally, we've produced two summary text files of the data: one for general efficiency scores, and one for the changed team data.
